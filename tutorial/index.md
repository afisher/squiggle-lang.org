# Introduction

## About this tutorial

Howdy! If you're reading this, hopefully it's because you're interested in
learning the Squiggle programming language. If so, read on!

## Prerequisites

If you have never used [Node.js][] or [npm][], you should learn those first.
This tutorial assumes you have both tools installed and are familiar with the
process of installing and using npm modules.

## Getting started

Squiggle can be installed via npm:

    npm install -g saikobee/squiggle

Eventually there will be a published npm package for Squiggle, but for now you
can just install it via the GitHub shorthand. Please be aware that Squiggle
fully intends to follow [Semantic Versioning][semver], but is currently version
zero, so things may change at any point.

## What about browsers?

You may have noticed all this talk about Node.js and not a word about browser
stuff. Well, Squiggle is totally compatible with browser environments! The
preferred way of using Squiggle code in the browser is via [Browserify][], but
it's also possible without that tool. More on this in a later chapter.

# The beginning

## Hello world

If you haven't read the introduction section, I highly recommend going back and
reading it. Everything at this point assumes you've read it.

Now why don't we write our first Squiggle program? Save it in a file called
`main.squiggle`.

    console.log("Hello, world!")

Funny enough, that is also a valid JavaScript program, but bear with me. Now to compile it, run:

    squiggle main.squiggle -o main.js

Feel free to take a look at `main.js` generated by Squiggle. It's a little
large, but that's mainly because Squiggle bundles the all of its necessary
functions into the `main.js` rather than writing two separate files.

To run it, use `node` just like you normally would:

    node main.js

You should see the program write out "Hello, world!" to the console.

## Interactive mode

Using Squiggle to compile a JavaScript file is the primary use case, but it also
features an interactive mode, also known as a REPL (historical reasons). In
order to use the REPL, simply run Squiggle as follows:

    squiggle -i

Squiggle explains everything you need to know from there. It's a great way to
quickly try something on your mind, without having to save y our work.

## Language overview

Squiggle does not invent its own world separate from JavaScript, Node.js, npm,
and friends. It is meant to be used within the existing JavaScript ecosystem,
calling JavaScript code, and being called from JavaScript.

The compiler transforms Squiggle files into JavaScript files, on a per-file
basis. You can then handle these JavaScript files just like you would hand-
written ones. Bundle them, `require` them, minify them, gzip them, whatever you
want.

## Literals

Numbers, strings, `true`, `false`, `null`, and `undefined` are all exactly
identical in Squiggle.

    100
    3.14
    "hello"
    ""
    true
    false
    null
    undefined

Currently only double-quoted string literals are supported (no 'single quotes'), and escape characters do not work (e.g. `\"`, `\n` ).

Arrays are slightly different: they are automatically wrapped in a call to
`Object.freeze`. This makes it so no elements in the array can change after it's
created. That means no `myArray.push(4)`. JavaScript arrays already have a
`.concat` method for adding elements to a copy of the array.

    []
    [1, 2, 3]
    [[], []]
    [[1, 2, 3], [[1], [2], []]]
    ["hello", "world"]

Objects are also wrapped in `Object.freeze`, though JavaScript does not provide
an easy way to add key-value pairs to a copy of an object. Squiggle will
eventually provide a convenient function for doing that. Also, Squiggle objects require quoting keys, because you can use computed values.

    {}
    {"a": "b"}
    {"hello world": "Hello, world!"}
    {"key": 400, "x": null, "y": undefined, "o": {}}
    {someStringVariable: someStringVariable}

Functions are wrapped in `Object.freeze` as well. Functions in JavaScript can
normally have properties added afterwards, but freezing them disables that.
Also, functions in Squiggle automatically have arity checking added. That means
that if you call a function with too many or too few arguments, it will throw an
error. Functions use `fn` and don't use braces or `return`.

    fn(x) x + 1
    fn(x, y) x + y
    fn() Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)
