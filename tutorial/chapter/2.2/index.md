title: "Interactive mode"
---

Using Squiggle to compile a JavaScript file is the primary use case, but it also
features an interactive mode, also known as a REPL (historical reasons). In
order to use the REPL, simply run Squiggle as follows:

```bash
squiggle -i
```

Squiggle explains everything you need to know from there. It's a great way to
quickly try something on your mind, without having to save your work.
