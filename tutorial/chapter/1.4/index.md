title: "What about browsers?"
---


You may have noticed all this talk about Node.js and not a word about browser
stuff. Well, Squiggle is totally compatible with browser environments! The
preferred way of using Squiggle code in the browser is via [Browserify][], but
it's also possible without that tool. More on this in a later chapter.
