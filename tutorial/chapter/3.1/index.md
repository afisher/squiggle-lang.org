title: "Utility functions"
---

There are plans to eventually include a library of utility functions to use with
Squiggle, in the spirit of [lodash][], but better suited for Squiggle.

The current idea is a few simple functions that don't pass extra parameters that
are  usually ignored, that never mutate data, and always return frozen data.
