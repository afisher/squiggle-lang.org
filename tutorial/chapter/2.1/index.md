title: "Hello world"
---

If you haven't read the introduction section, I highly recommend going back and
reading it. Everything at this point assumes you've read it.

Now why don't we write our first Squiggle program? Save it in a file called
`main.sqg`.

```squiggle
global.console.log("Hello, world!")
```

Now to compile it, run:

```bash
squiggle main.sqg main.js
```

Feel free to take a look at `main.js` generated by Squiggle. It's a little
large, but that's mainly because Squiggle bundles the all of its necessary
functions into the `main.js` rather than writing two separate files.

To run it, use `node` just like you normally would:

```bash
node main.js
```

You should see the program write out "Hello, world!" to the console.
