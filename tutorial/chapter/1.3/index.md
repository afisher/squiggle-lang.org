Squiggle can be installed via npm:

```bash
npm install -g squiggle-lang
```

Eventually there will be a published npm package for Squiggle, but for now you
can just install it via the GitHub shorthand. Please be aware that Squiggle
fully intends to follow [Semantic Versioning][semver], but is currently version
zero, so things may change at any point.

If you use [Sublime Text][sublime], there's a syntax highlighter plugin. You can install it via [Package Control][pkgctrl]. As of the time of this writing, it wasn't in the official package listing, so you have to run `Package Control: Add Repository` first for this URL:

```
https://github.com/wavebeem/squiggle-sublime
```

After that, `Package Control: Install Package` and look for `squiggle-sublime`.
