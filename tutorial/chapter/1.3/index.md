Squiggle can be installed via npm:

```bash
npm install -g squiggle-lang
```

Eventually there will be a published npm package for Squiggle, but for now you
can just install it via the GitHub shorthand. Please be aware that Squiggle
fully intends to follow [Semantic Versioning][semver], but is currently version
zero, so things may change at any point.

If you use [Sublime Text][sublime], there's a syntax highlighter plugin. You can install it via [Package Control][pkgctrl]. Simply open the command palette and use `Package Control: Install Package`, then type in **Squiggle**.

Now any files ending in *.sqg* will be highlighted automatically as Squiggle
code.
