Many programming languages have tools built around them called linters. Usually
these tools advise you of potential mistakes, or othwerwise ill-advised
techniques. Frequently these tools require configuration before use, and are
completely separate from the normal process of using the language.

In Squiggle, good code is paramount, so linting is built-in to the compiler, and
non-configurable. This ensures all projects using Squiggle will adhere to common
guidelines.

In addition, Squiggle is designed so that at the language level there are as few
"gotchas" as possible, reducing the amount of linting necessary.
