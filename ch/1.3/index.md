Squiggle can be installed via npm:

    npm install -g saikobee/squiggle

Eventually there will be a published npm package for Squiggle, but for now you
can just install it via the GitHub shorthand. Please be aware that Squiggle
fully intends to follow [Semantic Versioning][semver], but is currently version
zero, so things may change at any point.
